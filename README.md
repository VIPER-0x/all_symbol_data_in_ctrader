# all_symbol_data_in_ctrader
Your code effectively retrieves and prints all key properties of the current chart symbol, providing a detailed snapshot of its attributes. The implementation is thorough and organized. Here's a quick review and suggestions for potential enhancements:

---

### Code Highlights:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Includes nearly all significant properties such as bid/ask prices, pip size, tick size, commission details, and leverage.

2. **Dynamic Leverage Handling**:
   - Uses `string.Join` to format the dynamic leverage tiers for easier readability.

3. **Easy-to-Read Output**:
   - Organizes the output with clear property labels and values, making it easy to interpret.

### Suggested Enhancements:
1. **Add Point Value Calculation**:
   - Include a calculated point value using the formula:
     ```csharp
     double pointValue = Symbol.TickValue / (Symbol.TickSize / Symbol.PipSize);
     Print("Point Value: {0}", pointValue);
     ```

2. **Handle Missing or Unsupported Data**:
   - Wrap prints in a `try-catch` block for properties that might not be supported or initialized for certain symbols:
     ```csharp
     try
     {
         Print("PnL Conversion Fee Rate: {0}", Symbol.PnLConversionFeeRate);
     }
     catch (Exception ex)
     {
         Print("PnL Conversion Fee Rate is not available: {0}", ex.Message);
     }
     ```

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Extend the `OnTick` method to monitor properties like bid, ask, and spread for real-time changes:
     ```csharp
     protected override void OnTick()
     {
         Print("Real-Time Bid: {0}, Ask: {1}, Spread: {2}", Symbol.Bid, Symbol.Ask, Symbol.Spread);
     }
     ```

4. **Filter or Format Output**:
   - Include options to filter which properties to display or format the output for cleaner logs:
     ```csharp
     Print("{0,-30}: {1}", "Property Name", "Value");
     ```

5. **Handle Market Hours Details**:
   - Expand `MarketHours` output to display individual trading sessions for more detailed insights:
     ```csharp
     foreach (var session in Symbol.MarketHours.Sessions)
     {
         Print("Session: Start - {0}, End - {1}", session.Start, session.End);
     }
     ```
